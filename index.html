                    To me, my feelings about rainy seasons are a bit complicated. It's like a love-hate relationship. I was born in Bangkok, Thailand, where it's summer almost all the time, and I really dislike the hot and sweaty weather. That's why I have a bit of a love-hate thing with summer. Rainy seasons, on the other hand, give me a break from all that sweating and provide a fresh and cool change. Plus, there's something special about the sound and smell of rain that you can't find in any other season. I've listed five reasons why I love rainy seasons, and even though I'm aware of the downsides, my love for them still wins out.

                <h3>Pros of the rainy</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Renewal of Life:</em> Rainy seasons bring a fresh start to all forms of life. The rain nourishes plants and replenishes water sources, contributing to the growth of lush greenery and a rejuvenated ecosystem.</li>
                    <li><em>Air Quality Improvement:</em> Rain helps to cleanse the air by removing dust and pollutants. It washes away particles from the atmosphere, leading to improved air quality and better breathing conditions.</li>
                    <li><em>Diverse Landscapes:</em> Rainy seasons transform landscapes, whether you're by the beach or in the mountains. The added moisture creates vibrant and picturesque scenes that are a departure from the usual dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><em>Observing Wind Patterns:</em> Rainy seasons often come with winds. It's an excellent opportunity to observe and appreciate the patterns and strength of the wind, adding an element of wonder to the season.</li>
                    <li><em>Safe and Peaceful Environment:</em> Rainy seasons allow humans to stay comfortably at home. This can be seen as the most secure and tranquil time of the year, as you can avoid extreme weather conditions and enjoy the coziness of your home.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <q>Rainy seasons, despite occasional inconveniences, stand out as some of the best seasons globally. They usher in a renewal of life, nourishing plants and rejuvenating ecosystems. Moreover, they purify the air, cleansing it of dust and pollutants, contributing to improved overall health. Rainy seasons transform landscapes into vibrant, picturesque scenes, breaking the monotony of dry conditions. This natural beauty and environmental revitalization, combined with the soothing sound of raindrops, create a sense of tranquility and wonder that makes rainy seasons truly special.

            <h2>AGAINST BY KEITH</h2>
                <h3>Beyond the Surface: A Closer Look at its Advantages, Risks, and Emotional Impact
                </h3>
                <q>It is true that there are many advantages to the rainy season, but it is not enough to break even the disadvantages of it. There are several things to consider and be afraid of in the rainy season such as power outages, transportation delays, or even floods because nature is unpredictable. Not only those things, rainy days will also give a bad mood and vibes for several people that have special issues. Depression and Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) will likely be triggered because of the weather. So I have a strong belief that rainy weather is not as good as it seems and cannot be considered the best season.</q>

                <h2>Winter might seem harsh but its the best</h2>

                <p>Coming to Canada for the first time in my life, I faced winter for the first time! It is true that winter is so cold compared to my home country, Indonesia. Back in Indonesia, it is like summer for half a year, and rain for another half of it. There were only hot and humid seasons there that made me sweat a lot all day long! Even when it's night time. Feeling the breeze on winter in Canada feels kind of a “culture shock” for me, since I have never experienced it before. Yet I LOVE winter! Since I don't even sweat everytime I go for a walk or even a run outside. There was beautiful snow everywhere when it's snowing. Even though sometimes it gets really cold for me, I still love it better than a hot humid summer. So for me winter might get a little harsh but it is still the best season. To support my argument, I have listed five points of why winter is the best.</p>
                <h3>Pros of the winter</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>No Bugs in-sight:</em> When it is snow season, it is very rare to see bugs anywhere, be it inside or outside the house. This is a good thing because sometimes bugs can make our house dirty and uncomfortable. This also results in less to none population of mosquitos! It is so convenient that no bugs will annoy us in this season</li>
                    <li><em>Burning more Calories:</em> It has already been public knowledge that the colder the environment is, the more calories humans burn. This is a great thing for people to lose weight! In an article written by Bahar Gholipur at the Washington Post, he wrote that “New evidence suggests that regular exposure to mildly cold air may help people lose weight by increasing the amount of energy their bodies have to expend to keep their core temperature up, researchers say.</li>
                    <li><em>Unique Environment:</em> Winter gives us a chance to look at an extraordinary spectacle that mother nature gave to us. Yes that is right, it is snow! And snow creates so many unique and limited-time spectacle that only the people in the northern area can see. It is all white and clean in the environment because it is covered with snow.</li>
                    <li><em>Holidays:</em> There are so many holidays and events in the winter season! There are Christmas, Kwanza, Hanukkah, and many more! During this season people can take a break and have some family time or quality time with dear friends out of the busyness of each other's daily routine.</li>
                    <li><em>Winter Sports:</em> In Winter, there are so many sports that are unlocked! Sports such as skiing, snowboarding, sledding, and many others! These sports will only be available in winter, so experiencing these rare sports is an advantage not all people can enjoy.</li>
