                    To me, my feelings about rainy seasons are a bit complicated. It's like a love-hate relationship. I was born in Bangkok, Thailand, where it's summer almost all the time, and I really dislike the hot and sweaty weather. That's why I have a bit of a love-hate thing with summer. Rainy seasons, on the other hand, give me a break from all that sweating and provide a fresh and cool change. Plus, there's something special about the sound and smell of rain that you can't find in any other season. I've listed five reasons why I love rainy seasons, and even though I'm aware of the downsides, my love for them still wins out.
