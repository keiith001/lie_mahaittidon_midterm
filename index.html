                    To me, my feelings about rainy seasons are a bit complicated. It's like a love-hate relationship. I was born in Bangkok, Thailand, where it's summer almost all the time, and I really dislike the hot and sweaty weather. That's why I have a bit of a love-hate thing with summer. Rainy seasons, on the other hand, give me a break from all that sweating and provide a fresh and cool change. Plus, there's something special about the sound and smell of rain that you can't find in any other season. I've listed five reasons why I love rainy seasons, and even though I'm aware of the downsides, my love for them still wins out.
                </p>
                <h3>Pros of the rainy</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Renewal of Life:</em> Rainy seasons bring a fresh start to all forms of life. The rain nourishes plants and replenishes water sources, contributing to the growth of lush greenery and a rejuvenated ecosystem.</li>
                    <li><em>Air Quality Improvement:</em> Rain helps to cleanse the air by removing dust and pollutants. It washes away particles from the atmosphere, leading to improved air quality and better breathing conditions.</li>
                    <li><em>Diverse Landscapes:</em> Rainy seasons transform landscapes, whether you're by the beach or in the mountains. The added moisture creates vibrant and picturesque scenes that are a departure from the usual dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><em>Observing Wind Patterns:</em> Rainy seasons often come with winds. It's an excellent opportunity to observe and appreciate the patterns and strength of the wind, adding an element of wonder to the season.</li>
                    <li><em>Safe and Peaceful Environment:</em> Rainy seasons allow humans to stay comfortably at home. This can be seen as the most secure and tranquil time of the year, as you can avoid extreme weather conditions and enjoy the coziness of your home.
                    </li>
                </ol>
              
                <q>Rainy seasons, despite occasional inconveniences, stand out as some of the best seasons globally. They usher in a renewal of life, nourishing plants and rejuvenating ecosystems. Moreover, they purify the air, cleansing it of dust and pollutants, contributing to improved overall health. Rainy seasons transform landscapes into vibrant, picturesque scenes, breaking the monotony of dry conditions. This natural beauty and environmental revitalization, combined with the soothing sound of raindrops, create a sense of tranquility and wonder that makes rainy seasons truly special.

                <h3>Beyond the Surface: A Closer Look at its Advantages, Risks, and Emotional Impact
                </h3>
                <q>It is true that there are many advantages to the rainy season, but it is not enough to break even the disadvantages of it. There are several things to consider and be afraid of in the rainy season such as power outages, transportation delays, or even floods because nature is unpredictable. Not only those things, rainy days will also give a bad mood and vibes for several people that have special issues. Depression and Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) will likely be triggered because of the weather. So I have a strong belief that rainy weather is not as good as it seems and cannot be considered the best season.</q>

                <h3>Cons of the rainy</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Depression and Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):</em> For some individuals, prolonged periods of rain and gloomy weather can lead to feelings of depression and SAD. Reduced exposure to sunlight can affect mood and overall well-being.</li>
                    <li><em>Power Outages:</em> Storms often accompany rainy seasons, which can result in power outages due to lightning strikes or flooding of electrical infrastructure. This can disrupt daily life and business operations.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Transportation Delays:</em> Heavy rain can lead to transportation delays, including flight cancellations, road closures, and public transit disruptions. This can inconvenience commuters and travelers.</li>
                    <li><em>Disruption of Outdoor Activities:</em> Outdoor events, sports, and recreational activities can be hampered during rainy seasons due to wet conditions. This can limit opportunities for outdoor enjoyment.</li>
                    <li><em>Flooding and Waterlogging:</em> Excessive rainfall can lead to flooding and waterlogging, causing damage to homes, infrastructure, and agricultural fields. It can disrupt daily life and result in property losses.</li>

            <h2>Winter might seem harsh but its the best</h2>
            <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1438761/pexels-photo-1438761.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2" alt="Winter is the best season" width="800">
            <p>Coming to Canada for the first time in my life, I faced winter for the first time! It is true that winter is so cold compared to my home country, Indonesia. Back in Indonesia, it is like summer for half a year, and rain for another half of it. There were only hot and humid seasons there that made me sweat a lot all day long! Even when it's night time. Feeling the breeze on winter in Canada feels kind of a “culture shock” for me, since I have never experienced it before. Yet I LOVE winter! Since I don't even sweat everytime I go for a walk or even a run outside. There was beautiful snow everywhere when it's snowing. Even though sometimes it gets really cold for me, I still love it better than a hot humid summer. So for me winter might get a little harsh but it is still the best season. To support my argument, I have listed five points of why winter is the best.</p>
            <h3>Pros of the winter</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><em>No Bugs in-sight:</em> When it is snow season, it is very rare to see bugs anywhere, be it inside or outside the house. This is a good thing because sometimes bugs can make our house dirty and uncomfortable. This also results in less to none population of mosquitos! It is so convenient that no bugs will annoy us in this season</li>
                <li><em>Burning more Calories:</em> It has already been public knowledge that the colder the environment is, the more calories humans burn. This is a great thing for people to lose weight! In an article written by Bahar Gholipur at the Washington Post, he wrote that “New evidence suggests that regular exposure to mildly cold air may help people lose weight by increasing the amount of energy their bodies have to expend to keep their core temperature up, researchers say.</li>
                <li><em>Unique Environment:</em> Winter gives us a chance to look at an extraordinary spectacle that mother nature gave to us. Yes that is right, it is snow! And snow creates so many unique and limited-time spectacle that only the people in the northern area can see. It is all white and clean in the environment because it is covered with snow.</li>
                <li><em>Holidays:</em> There are so many holidays and events in the winter season! There are Christmas, Kwanza, Hanukkah, and many more! During this season people can take a break and have some family time or quality time with dear friends out of the busyness of each other's daily routine.</li>
                <li><em>Winter Sports:</em> In Winter, there are so many sports that are unlocked! Sports such as skiing, snowboarding, sledding, and many others! These sports will only be available in winter, so experiencing these rare sports is an advantage not all people can enjoy.</li>
            </ol>

            <q>Despite all the disadvantages that people can get in winter, it is still the best season compared to others. This is due to the fact that the advantages and benefits are overwhelming the disadvantages. Most of the disadvantages can be prevented even though it requires more effort. Whilst the advantages that people get from winter could not be achieved during other seasons. It is a special feature that only the winter season has. Not only that there are tons of limited-time events and features, but also having nice and chill weather on a daily basis. <strike> This will result in less sweat and a more comfortable environment to work without bugs and dirty areas.</strike> <b>I am not AGREE as well!</b> </q>

        <h2>AGAINST BY NATE</h2>
                <h3>Winter is not welcome: if you need to socialize and need warmer caring.</h3>
                <q>The snowy landscape appears romantic and stunning, but winter in Canada brings numerous challenges. This vast country presents difficulties not only for interpersonal communication and outdoor activities constrained by the cold weather but also for transportation methods like cars and associated maintenance expenses, to meet anyone you want to meet.</q>

                <h3>Cons of the winter</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Driving is harder:</em> While in winter, roads are sometimes packed with snows and ice that makes it so slippery. Even though there are companies that clean up the snow, it is not 100% gone and will still leave residues. This makes drivers have to be more cautious because there will be more likely to be accident due to the slippery road.</li>
                    <li><em>Need more effort to go outside:</em> In winter where the temperature can get below 0 degree celsius, it is bound to be cold. That means people will have to prepare themselves more before going out. Unlike in summer where people will only just use shorts and shirts, in winter they have to wear thick clothing like winter jackets, sweaters, hoodies, and others. It can be a burden for some people.</li>
                    <li><em>Maintenance for vehicles:</em> Having a vehicle is kinda tricky. When winter comes, people need to prepare their vehicles for it. There are specific tires that need to be adjusted to the vehicle for winter and safety purposes. This will be a hassle everytime winter comes, and is going to cost more than other seasons.</li>
                    <li><em>COLD:</em> Imaging having to take a bus in winter with -20 to -30 degree celsius. It is super cold and sometimes becomes unbearable. Some people will have no issues with it, but most people will suffer from the cold. This can lead to flu or cold and other illnesses.</li>
                    <li><em>Dry skin:</em> With this kind of cold and dry season, having dry skins or other skin issues are common. People will need to treat themselves with proper skin-care for the winter such as moisturizers. This will be a mandatory thing to do, especially with people that have sensitive skins.</li>
